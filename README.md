# Hangman Game - Fruits

This is a Python program for playing the classic Hangman game with a category of fruits. The program chooses a random fruit word from a list and the player has to guess it by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses.

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. The computer will choose a word from a list of fruits.
3. The player has to guess the word by suggesting one letter at a time.
4. The player has only 6 incorrect guesses to make before losing.
5. After each guess, the program will display the hangman figure and update the display of the word with correct guesses.
6. If the player guesses the word correctly within the allowed number of guesses, they win. Otherwise, they lose.

## Dependencies

The program uses the `random` module which is included in Python's standard library.
